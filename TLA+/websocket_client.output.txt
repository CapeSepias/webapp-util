Checking temporal properties for the complete state space with 14 total distinct states at (2022-05-13 08:44:43)
Finished checking temporal properties in 00s at 2022-05-13 08:44:43
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 4.7E-17
76 states generated, 14 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 4.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 3 and the 95th percentile is 3).
